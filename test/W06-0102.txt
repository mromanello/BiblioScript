Abstract
This paper reports on an initial and nec-
essary step toward the construction of a 
Pan-Chinese lexical resource. We inves-
tigated the regional variation of lexical 
items in two specific domains, finance 
and sports; and explored how much of 
such variation is covered in existing Chi-
nese synonym dictionaries, in particular 
the Tongyici Cilin. The domain-specific 
lexical items were obtained from subsec-
tions of a synchronous Chinese corpus, 
LIVAC. Results showed that 20-40% of 
the words from various subcorpora are 
unique to the individual communities, 
and as much as 70% of such unique items 
are not yet covered in the Tongyici Cilin. 
The results suggested great potential for 
building a Pan-Chinese lexical resource 
for Chinese language processing. Our 
next step would be to explore automatic 
means for extracting related lexical items 
from the corpus, and to incorporate them 
into existing semantic classifications.
1 Introduction
Many cities have underground railway systems. 
Somehow one takes the tube in London but the 
subway in New York. In a more recent edition 
of the Roget's Thesaurus (Kirkpatrick, 1987), 
subway, tube, underground railway and metro 
are found in the same semicolon-separated group 
under head 624 Way. Similarly if one looks up 
WordNet (http://wordnet.princeton.edu; Miller et 
al., 1990), the synset to which subway belongs 
also contains the words metro, tube, under-
ground, and subway system; and it is further in-
dicated that "in Paris the subway system is called 
the `metro' and in London it is called the `tube' 
or the `underground''. Such regional lexical 
variation is also found in Chinese. For instance, 
the subway system in Hong Kong, known as the 
Mass Transit Railway or MTR, is called +'J0 in 
Chinese. The subway systems in Beijing and 
Shanghai, as well as the one in Singapore, are 
also known as +'J0, but that in Taipei is known 
as L—PI. Their counterpart in Japan is written as 
+'J__k 4;zP in Kanji. Such regional variation, as part 
of lexical knowledge, is important and useful for 
many natural language applications, including 
natural language understanding, information re-
trieval, and machine translation. Unfortunately, 
existing Chinese lexical resources often lack 
such comprehensiveness.
To fill this gap, Tsou and Kwong (2006) pro-
posed a comprehensive Pan-Chinese lexical re-
source, based on a large and unique synchronous 
Chinese corpus as an authentic basis for lexical 
acquisition and analysis across various Chinese 
speech communities. For a significant world 
language like Chinese, a useful lexical resource 
should have maximum versatility and portability. 
It is not sufficient to target at one particular 
community speaking the language and thus cover 
only language usage observed from that particu-
lar community. Instead, such a lexical resource 
should document the core and universal sub-
stances of the language on the one hand, and also 
the more subtle variations found in different 
communities on the other. As is evident from the 
above example on the variation of subway, re-
gional variation should be captured for the lexi-
cal resource to be useful in a wide range of ap-
plications.
In this study, we investigate and compare the 
regional variation of lexical items from two spe-

cific domains, finance and sports, as an initial 
and necessary step toward the more important 
undertaking of building a Pan-Chinese lexical 
resource. In addition, we make use of an exist-
ing Chinese synonym dictionary, the Tongyici 
Cilin (Mei et al., 1984) as leverage, and explore 
its coverage of such variation and thus the poten-
tial for enriching it. The lexical items under 
study were obtained from a synchronous Chinese 
corpus, LIVAC, which will be further introduced 
in Section 4. Corpus data from four Chinese 
speech communities were compared with respect 
to their commonality and uniqueness, and also 
against Cilin for their coverage. Results showed 
that 20-40% of the words extracted from the cor-
pus are unique to the individual communities, 
and as much as 70% of such unique items are not 
yet covered in Cilin. It therefore suggests that 
the synchronous corpus is a rich source for 
mining region-specific lexical items, and there is 
great potential for building a Pan-Chinese lexical 
resource for Chinese language processing.
In Section 2, we will briefly review existing 
resources and related work. Then in Section 3, 
we will briefly outline the design and architec-
ture of the Pan-Chinese lexical resource pro-
posed by Tsou and Kwong (2006). In Section 4, 
we will further describe the Chinese synonym 
dictionary and the synchronous Chinese corpus 
used in this study. The comparison of their lexi-
cal items will be discussed in Section 5. Future 
directions will be presented in Section 6, fol-
lowed by a conclusion.
2 Existing Resources and Related Work
The construction and development of large 
lexical resources is relying more and more on 
corpus-based approaches, not only as a result of 
the increased availability of large corpora, but 
also for the authoritativeness and authenticity 
allowed by the approach. The Collins 
COBUILD English Dictionary (Sinclair, 1987) is 
amongst the most well-known lexicographic fruit 
based on large corpora.
For natural language applications, much of the 
information in conventional dictionaries targeted 
at human readers must be made explicit. Lexical 
resources for computer use thus need consider-
able manipulation, customisation, and supple-
mentation (e.g. Calzolari, 1982). WordNet 
(Miller et al., 1990), grouping words into synsets 
and linking them up with relational pointers, is 
probably the first broad coverage general compu-
tational lexical database. In view of the intensive 
time and effort required in resource building, 
some researchers have taken an alternative route 
by extracting information from existing machine- 
readable dictionaries and corpora semi-
automatically (e.g. Vossen et al., 1989; Riloff 
and Shepherd, 1999; Lin et al, 2003).
Compared to the development of thesauri and 
lexical databases, and research into semantic 
networks for major languages such as English, 
similar work for the Chinese language is less 
mature. This gap was partly due to the lack of 
authoritative Chinese corpora as a basis for 
analysis, but has been gradually reduced with the 
recent availability of large Chinese corpora in-
cluding the LIVAC synchronous corpus (Tsou 
and Lai, 2003) used in this work and further de-
scribed below, the Sinica Corpus (Chen et al., 
1996), the Chinese Penn Treebank (Xia et al., 
2000), and the like.
An important issue which is seldom addressed 
in the construction of Chinese lexical databases 
is the problem of versatility and portability. For 
a language such as Chinese which is spoken in 
many different communities, different linguistic 
norms have emerged as a result of the individual-
istic evolution and development of the language 
within a particular community and culture. Such 
variations are seldom adequately reflected in ex-
isting lexical resources, which often only draw 
reference from one particular source. For in-
stance, Tongyici Cilin(�����) (Mei et al., 
1984) is a thesaurus containing some 70,000 
Chinese lexical items in the tradition of the Ro-
get's Thesaurus for English, that is, in a hierar-
chy of broad conceptual categories. First pub-
lished in the 1980s, it was based exclusively on 
Chinese as used in post-1949 Mainland China. 
Thus for the subway example above, the closest 
word group found is ' F 41 , 1741 (train) only, let 
alone the subway itself and its regional variations.
With the recent availability of large corpora, 
especially synchronous ones, to construct an au-
thoritative and timely lexical resource for Chi-
nese is less distant than it was in the past. A 
large synchronous corpus provides authentic ex-
amples of the language as used in a variety of 
locations. It thus enables us to attempt a com-
prehensive and in-depth analysis of the core 
common language in constructing a lexical re-
source; and to incorporate useful information 
relating to location-sensitive linguistic variations.

3 Proposal of a Pan-Chinese Thesaurus
The Pan-Chinese lexicon proposed by Tsou and 
Kwong (2006) is expected to capture not only the 
core senses of lexical items but also senses and 
uses specific to individual Chinese speech 
communities.
The lexical database will be organised into a 
core database and a supplementary one. The 
core database will contain the core lexical infor-
mation for word senses and usages which are 
common to most Chinese speech communities, 
whereas the supplementary database will contain 
the language uses specific to individual commu-
nities, including "marginal" and "sublanguage" 
uses.
A network structure will be adopted for the 
lexical items. The nodes could be sets of near- 
synonyms or single lexical items (in which case 
synonymy will be one type of links). The links 
will not only represent the paradigmatic semantic 
relations but also syntagmatic ones (such as se-
lectional restrictions).
We thus begin by investigating in depth the 
regional variation of lexical items, especially 
domain-specific words, among several Chinese 
speech communities. In addition, we explore the 
potential of enriching existing resources as a start. 
In the following section, we will discuss the 
Tongyici Cilin and the synchronous Chinese cor-
pus used in this study in greater details.
4 Materials and Method 
4.1 The Tongyici Cilin
The Tongyici Cilin(同義詞詞林) (Mei et al.,  
1984) is a Chinese synonym dictionary, or more 
often known as a Chinese thesaurus in the tradi-
tion of the Roget's Thesaurus for English. The 
Roget's Thesaurus has about 1,000 numbered 
semantic heads, more generally grouped under 
higher level semantic classes and subclasses, and
more specifically differentiated into paragraphs 
and semicolon-separated word groups. Similarly, 
some 70,000 Chinese lexical items are organized 
into a hierarchy of broad conceptual categories in 
the Tongyici Cilin. Its classification consists of 
12 top-level semantic classes, 94 sub-classes, 
1,248 semantic heads and 3,925 paragraphs.
4.2 The LIVAC Synchronous Corpus
LIVAC (http://www.livac.org) stands for Lin-
guistic Variation in Chinese Speech Communi-
ties. It is a synchronous corpus developed by the 
Language Information Sciences Research Centre 
of the City University of Hong Kong since 1995 
(Tsou and Lai, 2003). The corpus consists of 
newspaper articles collected regularly and syn-
chronously from six Chinese speech communi-
ties, namely Hong Kong, Beijing, Taipei, Singa-
pore, Shanghai, and Macau. Texts collected 
cover a variety of domains, including front page 
news stories, local news, international news, edi-
torials, sports news, entertainment news, and fi-
nancial news. Up to December 2005, the corpus 
has already accumulated about 180 million char-
acter tokens which, upon automatic word seg-
mentation and manual verification, amount to 
over 900K word types.
For the present study, we make use of the sub- 
corpora collected over the 9-year period 1995- 
2004 from Hong Kong (HK), Beijing (BJ), 
Taipei (TW), and Singapore (SG). In particular, 
we focus on the financial news and sports news 
to investigate the commonality and uniqueness of 
the lexical items used in these specific domains 
in the various communities. We also evaluate 
the adequacy of the Tongyici Cilin in terms of its 
coverage of such domain-specific terms espe-
cially from the Pan-Chinese perspective, and 
thus assess the room for its enrichment with the 
synchronous corpus. Table 1 shows the sizes of 
the subcorpora used for this study.

4.3 Procedures
Word-frequency lists were generated from the 
financial and sports subcorpora from each indi-
vidual community. For each resulting list, the 
steps below were followed to remove irrelevant 
items and retain only the potentially useful con-
tent words:
(a) Remove all numbers and non-Chinese words.
(b) Remove all proper names, including those 
annotated as personal names, geographical 
names, and organisation names. Proper 
names have been annotated in the corpora 
during the process of word segmentation.
(c) Remove function words.
(d) Remove lexical items with frequency 5 or 
below.
The numbers of remaining items in each sub- 
corpus after the above steps are listed in Tables 2 
and 3 for the two domains respectively. The 
lexical items retained, which are expected to con-
tain a substantial amount of content words, are 
potentially useful for the current study. The lists 
in each domain (from the various subcorpora) 
were compared in terms of the items they share 
and those unique to individual communities. 
Their unique items were also compared against 
the Tongyici Cilin to investigate its adequacy 
and explore how it might be enriched with the 
synchronous corpus.

5 Results and Discussion
5.1 Lexical Items from LIVAC
The four subcorpora of the financial domain 
differ considerably in their sizes, and slightly less 
so for the sports domain. Despite this, we ob-
served for both domains from Tables 2 and 3 that 
in general about 40-50% of all word types are 
numbers, non-Chinese words, proper names, and 
function words. Of the remaining items, about 
20-30% have frequency greater than 5. These 
several thousand word types from each subcor-
pus are expected to be amongst the more interest-
ing items and form the "candidate sets" for fur-
ther investigation.
5.2 Commonality among Various Regions
Comparing the candidate sets from various sub- 
corpora, which reflect the use of Chinese in vari-
ous Chinese speech communities, Tables 4 and 5
show the sizes of the intersection sets among 
different places for the two domains respectively.
The intersection set for all four places contains 
slightly more than 1,000 lexical items in the fi-
nancial domain. A quick skim through these 
common lexical items suggests that they contain, 
on the one hand, the many general concepts in 
the financial domain (e.g. FlJ company, VA 
market, �,KLi7 bank, JOV:r invest / investment, � 
�business, gW develop / development, PRI 
corporation, J!U f,j stock shares, J!U4 shareholder, 
V:r�capital, etc.); and on the other hand, many 
reportage and cognitive verbs often used in news 
articles (e.g. i, express, � d reckon, << , ,! 
appear, '--M reflect, etc.).
In the sports domain, more than 1,700 lexical 
items were found in all of the four subcorpora. 
Like its financial counterpart, we found many 
general concepts at the top of the list (e.g. 5N _J 
player, 5N�- team,rjf match, r competi-
12
tion,	r league, " t coach, W opponent,
ice'#i champion, etc.).
The numbers of overlaps in Tables 4 suggest 
that lexical items used in Mainland China (as 
evident from BJ data) seem to have the least in 
common with the rest. For instance, compared to 
the overlap amongst all four regions (i.e. 1,039), 
the overlap has increased most when BJ was not 
included in the comparison; and when we com-
pare any two regions, the overlap between BJ 
and TW is smallest. Nevertheless, such unique-
ness of BJ data is less apparent in the sports do-
main. In particular, the difference between 
HK/BJ and BJ/TW is even slightly less than that 
in the financial domain.
If we look at the individual regions, HK ap-
parently shares most (about 50%) with SG, and 
vice versa (about 68%), in the financial domain. 
At the same time, BJ also shares more with HK 
than with the other two regions, and so does TW. 
But surprisingly, BJ has over 60% overlap with 
SG and about 55% with TW in the sports domain. 
The overlaps of TW with HK and with BJ differ 
by more than 20% in the finance domain, but 
only by about 10% in the sports domain. All 
these patterns might suggest lexical items in the 
financial domain are more versatile and have 
more varied focus in different communities, 
whereas those in the sports domain reflect the 
more common interests of different places.

Table 5 Commonality amongst various regions for the sports domain
5.3 Uniqueness of Various Regions
Next we compared the lists with respect to what 
they have unique to themselves. Table 6 shows 
the numbers of unique items found in each list,
together with examples from the most frequent 
20 unique items in each case.
Again, taking the size difference among the 
candidate sets into account, about 40% of the 
lexical items found in HK data are unique to the 
region, which re-echoes the versatility and wide
13
coverage of interests of HK data. This is espe-
cially evident when compared to only about 20% 
of the candidate sets for SG are unique to Singa-
pore.1
Looking at the unique lexical items found in 
individual regions, it is not difficult to see the 
region-specific lexicalisation of certain concepts. 
For instance, in terms of housing, f z (housing 
under the Home Ownership Scheme) is a specific 
kind of housing in Hong Kong, � z is a specific 
term in Singapore (as seen in SG data), whereas 
housing is generally expressed as (� Y in 
Mainland China (as seen in BJ data). Similarly, 
�;; (HK) and '_F ON " (BJ) both refer to training, 
but may relate to different practice in the two 
communities. Such regional variation lends 
strong support to the importance of a Pan- 
Chinese lexical resource.
The lists of unique items also suggest the vari-
ous focus and orientation in different Chinese 
speech communities. For example, while Hong 
Kong pays much attention to the real estate mar-
ket and stock market, Mainland China may be 
focusing more on the basic needs like water, 
farming, poverty alleviation, etc., and Singapore 
is relatively more concerned with local affairs 
like port management. The passion for baseball, 
among other more popular sports like soccer, is 
most obvious from the unique lexical items 
found in TW data.
5.4 Comparison with Tongyici Cilin
As mentioned earlier, the Tongyici Cilin contains 
some 70,000 lexical items under 12 broad se-
mantic classes, 94 subclasses, and 1,428 heads. 
It was first published in the 1980s and was based 
on lexical usages mostly of post-1949 Mainland 
China. In this section, we discuss the results ob-
tained from comparing the unique lexical items 
found from individual subcorpora with Cilin, 
which are shown in Table 7.
On the one hand, Cilin's collection of words 
may be considerably dated and obviously will 
not include new concepts and neologisms arising 
in the last two decades. On the other hand, the 
data in LIVAC come from newspaper materials 
in the 1990s. So overall speaking, for each of the 
unique word lists, much less than 50% are cov-
ered in Cilin.
1 Upon further analysis, on average about 60% of these 
"unique" items were actually found in one or more of the 
other regions, but with frequency 5 or below. Since the 
difference in frequency is quite large for most items, we can 
reasonably treat them as unique to a particular community.
Nevertheless, there is still an apparent gap be-
tween Cilin's coverage of the unique items from 
various places. About 40% of the unique items 
found in BJ for both domains are covered; but 
for other places, the coverage is more often less 
than 30% in either or both domains. Again, this 
could be considered a result of Cilin's bias to-
ward lexical usages in Mainland China.
In addition, while almost 40% of the unique 
items in BJ data are found in Cilin, many of 
these unique items covered are amongst the most 
frequent items. On the contrary, even though 
about 560 unique items in HK data are also 
found in Cilin, only 3 out of the 20 most frequent 
items are amongst them. In addition, the appar-
ent coverage does not necessarily suggest the 
correct match of word senses. For instance, fz 
is found under head Bnl together with other 
items like � Y, (�=�', etc., all of which only re-
fer to the general concept of housing, instead of 
the housing specifically under the Home Owner-
ship Scheme as known in Hong Kong. Also, 
coverage of words like V_ ,�1�' and -1—f- in 
the sports domain does not match their actual 
usages which refer to team names. A more inter-
esting example might be 'F `'', which is used in 
the basketball context in TW data, and in no way 
refers to the literal "hot pot" sense.
Results from the above comparisons thus sup-
port that (1) different Chinese speech communi-
ties have their distinct usage of Chinese lexical 
items, in terms of both form and sense; (2) such 
variation is found in different domains, such as 
the financial and sports domain; (3) existing 
lexical resources, the Tongyici Cilin in particular 
as in our current study, should be enriched and 
enhanced by capturing lexical usages from a va-
riety of Chinese speech communities, to repre-
sent the lexical items from a Pan-Chinese per-
spective; and (4) lexical items obtained from the 
synchronous Chinese corpus can supplement the 
existing content of the Tongyici Cilin, with more 
contemporarily lexicalised concepts, as well as 
variant expressions of similar and related con-
cepts from various Chinese speech communities.
Hence it remains for us to further investigate 
how the related lexical items obtained from the 
synchronous corpus should be grouped and in-
corporated into the semantic classification of ex-
isting lexical resources; and to further explore 
how they might be extracted in a large scale by 
automatic means. These will definitely be 
amongst the most important future directions as 
discussed in the next section.

6 Future Work
In the current study, we have investigated the 
regional variation of lexical items from the fi-
nancial and sports domain, and the coverage of 
the Tongyici Cilin for such variation. The results 
suggested great potential for building a Pan- 
Chinese lexical resource for Chinese language 
processing. Our next step would thus be to fur-
ther investigate more automatic means for ex-
tracting the near-synonymous or closely related 
items from the various subcorpora. To this end, 
we would explore algorithms like those used in 
Lin et al. (2003). Of similar importance is the 
mechanism for grouping the related lexical items 
and incorporating them into the semantic classi-
fications of existing lexical resources. In this 
regard we will proceed with further in-depth 
analysis of the classificatory structures of indi-
vidual resources and fit in our Pan-Chinese ar-
chitecture.
Apart from the Tongyici Cilin, there are other 
existing Chinese lexical resources such as 
HowNet (Dong and Dong, 2000), SUMO and 
Chinese WordNet (Huang et al., 2004), as well 
as other synonym dictionaries from which we 
might draw reference to build up our Pan- 
Chinese lexical resource.
7 Conclusion
In this paper, we have investigated the regional 
variation of lexical items in two specific domains 
from a synchronous Chinese corpus, and ex-
plored their coverage in a Chinese synonym dic-
tionary. Results are encouraging in the sense 
that 20-40% of the candidate words from various 
subcorpora are unique to the individual commu-
nities, and as much as 70% of such unique items 
are not yet covered in the Tongyici Cilin. It 
therefore suggests great importance and potential 
for a Pan-Chinese lexical resource which we aim 
to construct. The synchronous corpus is a valu-
able resource for mining the region-specific 
expressions while existing synonym dictionaries 
might provide a ready-made semantic classifica-
tory structure. Our next step would be to explore 
automatic means for extracting related lexical 
items from the corpus, and to incorporate them 
into existing semantic classifications.
