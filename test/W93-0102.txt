Abstract
Automatic corpus-based sense resolution, or sense disambiguation, techniques tend to 
focus either on very local context or on topical context. Both components are needed 
for word sense resolution. A contextual representation of a word sense consists of top-
ical context and local context. Our goal is to construct contextual representations by 
automatically extracting topical and local information from textual corpora. We re-
view an experiment evaluating three statistical classifiers that automatically extract 
topical context. An experiment designed to examine human subject performance 
with similar input is described. Finally, we investigate a method for automatically 
extracting local context from a corpus. Preliminary results show improved perfor-
mance.
1 Contextual Representations
The goal of automatic sense resolution is to acquire a contextual representation of word 
senses. A contextual representation, as defined by Miller and Charles [7], is a characteri-
zation of the linguistic contexts in which a word can be used. We look at two components 
of contextual representations that can be automatically extracted from textual corpora 
using statistical methods. These axe topical context and local context.
Topical context is comprised of substantive words that are likely to co-occur with a 
given sense of a target word. If, for example, the polysemous word line occurs in a sentence 
with poetry and write, it is probably being used to express a different sense of line than 
if it occurred with stand and wait. Topical context is relatively insensitive to the order 
of words or their grammatical inflections; the focus is on the meanings of the open-class 
words that are used together in the same sentences.
Local context includes information on word order, distance and syntactic structure. For 
example, a line from does not suggest the same sense as in line for. Order and inflection 
are critical clues for local information, which is not restricted to open-class words.
In the next section, we briefly review an experiment using three statistical classifiers 
designed for sense resolution, and show that they are effective in extracting topical con-
text. Section 3 describes an experiment that was performed to establish the upper bound 
of performance for these classifiers. Section 4 presents some techniques that we are devel-
oping to extract local context.
2 Acquiring Topical Context
Of the two types of context features, topical ones seem easier to identify. The idea is 
simple: for any topic there is a sub-vocabulary of terms that are appropriate for discussing
10
it. The task is to identify the topic, then to select that sense of the polysemous word that 
best fits the topic. For example, if the topic is writing, then sheet probably refers to a 
piece of paper; if the topic is sleeping, then it probably refers to bed linen; if the topic is 
sailing, it could refer to a sail; and so on.
Instead of using topics to discover senses, one can use senses to discover topics. That 
is to say, if the senses are known in advance for a textual corpus, it is possible to search 
for words that are likely to co-occur with each sense. This strategy requires two steps. 
It is necessary (1) to partition a sizeable number of occurrences of a polysemous word 
according to its senses, and then (2) to use the resulting sets of instances to search for 
co-occurring words that are diagnostic of each sense. That was the strategy followed with 
considerable success by Gale, Church, and Yarowsky [1], who used a bilingual corpus for 
(1), and a Bayesian decision system for (2).
To understand this and other statistical systems better, we posed a very specific prob-
lem: given a set of contexts, each containing the noun line in a known sense, construct 
a classifier that selects the correct sense of line for new contexts. To see how the degree 
of polysemy affects performance, we ran three- and six-sense tasks. A full description 
of the three-sense task is reported in Voorhees, et. al. [11], and the six-sense task in 
Leacock, et. al [5]. These experiments are reviewed briefly below.
We tested three corpus-based statistical sense resolution methods which attempt to 
infer the correct sense of a polysemous word by using knowledge about patterns of word 
co-occurrences. The first technique, developed by Gale et. al. [1] at AT&T Bell Labora-
tories, is based on Bayesian decision theory, the second is based on neural network with 
back propagation [9], and the third is based on content vectors as used in information 
retrieval [10]. The only information used by the three classifiers is co-occurrence of char-
acter strings in the contexts. They use no other cues, such as syntactic tags or word 
order, nor do they require any augmentation of the training and testing data that is not 
fully automatic. The Bayesian classifier uses all of the information in the sentence except 
word order. That is, it uses punctuation, upper/lower case distinctions, and inflectional 
endings. The other two classifiers remove punctuation and convert all characters to lower 
case. In addition, they remove a list of stop words, a set of about 570 very high frequency 
words that includes most function words as well as some content words. The remaining 
strings are stemmed: suffixes are removed to conflate across morphological distinctions. 
For example, the strings computer(s), computing, computation(al), etc. are conflated to 
the stem comput.
2.1 Methodology
The training and testing contexts were taken from the 1987-89 Wall Street Journal corpus 
and from the APHB corpus.' Sentences containing line(s) and Line(s) were extracted 
and manually assigned a single sense from WordNet.2 Sentences with proper names con-
taining Line, such as Japan Air Lines, were removed from the set of sentences. Sentences 
containing collocations that have a single sense in WordNet, such as product line and line 
of products, were also excluded since the collocations are not ambiguous.
'The 25 million word corpus, obtained from the American Printing House for the Blind, is archived at 
IBM's T.J. Watson Research Center; it consists of stories and articles from books and general circulation 
magazines.
2WordNet is a lexical database developed by George Miller and his colleagues at Princeton Univer-
sity [6].
11
Typically, experiments have used a fixed number of words or characters on either 
side of the target word as the context. In these experiments, we used linguistic units — 
sentences — instead. Since the target word is often used anaphorically to refer back to the 
previous sentence, as in:
That was the last time Bell ever talked on the phone. He couldn't get his wife 
off the line.
we chose to use two-sentence contexts: the sentence containing line and the preceding 
sentence. However, if the sentence containing line was the first sentence in the article, 
then the context consists of one sentence. If the preceding sentence also contained line in 
the same sense, then an additional preceding sentence was added to the context, creating 
contexts three or more sentences long. The average size of the training and testing contexts 
was 44.5 words.
The sense resolution task used the following six senses of the noun line:
1. a product: ... a new line of midsized cars ...
2. a formation of people or things: People waited patiently in long lines ...
3. spoken or written test: One winning line from that speech ...
4. a thin, flexible object; cord: With a line tied to his foot, ...
5. an abstract division: ... the Amish draw no line between work and religion and life.
6. a telephone connection: One key to WordPerfect's growth was its toll-free help line
The classifiers were run three times each on randomly selected training sets. The set of 
contexts for each sense was randomly permuted, with each permutation corresponding 
to one trial. For each trial, the first 200 contexts of each sense were selected as training 
contexts. The next 149 contexts were selected as test contexts. The remaining contexts 
were not used in that trial. The 200 training contexts for each sense were combined to 
form a final training set of size 1200. The final test set contained the 149 test contexts 
from each sense, for a total of 894 contexts. To test the effect that the number of training 
examples has on classifier performance, smaller training sets of 50 and 100 contexts were 
extracted from the 200 context training set.
2.2 Results
All of the classifiers performed best with the largest number (200) of training contexts, 
and the percent correct results reported here are averaged over the three trials with 200 
training contexts. On the six-sense task, the Bayesian classifier averaged 71% correct 
answers, the content vector classifier 72%, and the neural networks 76%. None of these 
differences are statistically significant due to the limited sample size of three trials.
The ten most heavily weighted tokens for each sense for each classifier appear in 
Table 1. The words on the list seem, for the most part, indicative of the target sense 
and are reasonable indicators of topical context. However, there are some consistent 
differences among the methods. For example, while the Bayesian method is sensitive 
to proper nouns, the neural network appears to have no such preference. To test the 
hypothesis that the methods have different response patterns, we performed the x2 test for 
correlated proportions. This test measures how consistently the methods treat individual 
test contexts by determining whether the classifiers are making the same classification 
errors in each of the senses.

The results of the x2 test for a three-sense resolution task (product, formation and 
tezt),3 indicate that the response pattern of the content vector classifier is significantly 
different from the patterns of both the Bayesian and neural network classifiers, but the 
Bayesian response pattern is significantly different from the neural network pattern for 
the product sense only. In the six-sense disambiguation task, the X2 results indicate 
that the Bayesian and neural network classifiers' response patterns are not significantly 
different for any sense. The neural network and Bayesian classifiers' response patterns 
are significantly different from the content vector classifier only in the formation and test 
senses. Therefore, with the addition of three senses, the classifiers' response patterns 
appear to be converging.
A pilot two-sense distinction task (between product and formation) yielded over 90% 
correct answers.4 In the three-sense distinction task, the three classifiers had a mean of 
76% correct, yielding a sharp degradation with the addition of a third sense. Therefore, we 
hypothesized degree of polysemy to be a major factor for performance. We were surprised 
to find that in the six-sense task, all three classifiers degraded only slightly from the three- 
sense task, with a mean of 73% correct. Although the addition of three new senses to 
the task caused consistent degradation, the degradation is relatively slight. Hence, we 
conclude that some senses are harder to resolve than others, and it appears that overall 
accuracy is a function of the difficulty of the sense rather than being strictly a function of 
the degree of polysemy. The hardest sense for all three classifiers to learn was test, followed 
by formation, followed by division. The difficulty in training for the product, phone, and 
cord senses varied among the classifiers, but they were the three 'easiest' senses across 
the classifiers. To test our conclusion that the difficulty involved in learning individual 
senses is a greater factor for performance than degree of polysemy, we ran a three-way 
experiment on the three 'easy' senses. On this task, the content vector classifier achieved 
90% accuracy and neural network classifier 92% accuracy.
The convergence of the response patterns for the three methods suggests that each 
of the classifiers is extracting as much data as is available in word co-occurrences in 
the training contexts. If this is the case, any technique that uses only word counts will 
not be significantly more accurate than the techniques tested here. Although the degree 
of polysemy does affect the difficulty of the sense resolution task, a greater factor' for 
performance is the difficulty of resolving individual senses. From inspection of the contexts 
for the various senses, it appears that the senses of line that were easy to learn tend to 
be surrounded by a lot of topical context. With the senses that were hard to learn, the 
crucial disambiguating information tends to be very local, so that a greater proportion 
of the context is noise. Although it is recognized that local information is more reliable 
than distant information, the classifiers make no use of locality. Figure 1 shows some 
representative contexts for each sense of line used in the study. The product, phone 
and cord senses contain a lot of topical context, while the other senses have little or no 
information that is not very local.
The three classifiers are doing a good job finding topical context. However, simply 
knowing which words are likely to co-occur in the same sentences when a particular topic 
is under discussion is not sufficient for sense resolution.
sTraining and test sets for these senses are identical to those in the six-sense resolution task. 
4This task was only run with the content vector and neural network classifiers.

3 An Upper Bound For Classifier Performance
In an effort to establish an upper bound for performance on corpus-based statistical sense 
resolution methods, we decided to see how humans would perform on a sense resolution 
task using the same input that drives the statistical classifiers [4]. An experiment was 
designed to answer the following questions:
1. How do humans perform in a sense resolution task when given the same testing 
input as the statistical classifiers?
2. Are the contexts that are hard/easy for the statistical classifiers also hard/easy for 
people?
The three-sense task was replicated using human subjects. For each of the three senses 
of line (product, test, and formation), we selected 10 easy contexts (contexts that were 
correctly classified by the three statistical methods) and 10 hard contexts (contexts that 
were misclassified by the three methods), for a total of 60 contexts. These contexts were 
prepared in three formats: (1) a sentential form (as they originally appeared in the corpus), 
(2) a long list format (as was used by the Bayesian classifier), and (3) a short list format 
(as was used by the content vector and neural network classifiers). In order to mimic 
the fact that the classifiers do not use word order, collocations, or syntactic structure, 
the latter two contexts were presented to the subjects as word lists in reverse alphabetical 
order. 36 subjects each saw 60 contexts, 20 in each of the three formats, and were asked to 
choose the appropriate sense of line. The order in which the formats were presented was 
counter-balanced across subjects. No subject saw the same context twice. The subjects 
were Princeton undergraduates who were paid for their participation.
Human subjects performed almost perfectly on the sentential formats and had about 
a 32% error rate on the list formats. There was no significant difference between the two 
list formats — indicating that function words are of no use for sense resolution when word 
order is lost. They made significantly more errors on the contexts that were hard for the 
statistical classifiers, and fewer errors on the contexts that were easy for the classifiers. 
Not all the senses were equally difficult for human subjects: there were significantly fewer 
errors for the product sense of line than for the test and formation senses. Error rates for 
the subjects on the list formats were almost 50% for the hard contexts (contexts where 
the classifiers performed with 100% error), so subjects performed much better than the 
classifiers on these contexts. However, on the easy contexts, where the classifiers made no 
errors, the students showed an error rate of approximately 15%.
When subjects see the original sentences and therefore have access to all cues, both 
topical and local, they resolve the senses of line with 98% accuracy. When they are given 
the contexts in a list format, and are getting only topical cues, their performance drops 
to about 70% accuracy. Although their performance was significantly better than the 
classifiers (which all performed at 50% accuracy on this sample) human subjecrts are not 
able to disambiguate effectively using only topical context. From this result we conclude 
that in order to improve the performance of automatic classifiers, we need to incorporate 
local information into the statistical methods.

4 Acquiring Local Context
Kelly and Stone [3] pioneered research in finding local context by creating algorithms for 
automatic sense resolution. Over a period of seven years in the early 1970s, they (and 
some 30 students) hand coded sets of ordered rules for disambiguating 671 words. The 
rules include syntactic markers (part of speech, position within the sentence, punctuation, 
inflection), semantic markers and selectional restrictions, and words occurring within a 
specified distance before and/or after the target. An obvious shortcoming of this approach 
is the amount of work involved.
Recently there has been much interest in automatic and semi-automatic acquisition of 
local context (Hearst [2], Resnik [8], Yarowsky [13]). These systems are all plagued with 
the same problem, excellent precision but low recall. That is, if the local information that 
the methods learn is also present in a novel context, then that information is very reliable. 
However, quite frequently no local context match is found in a novel context. Given the 
sparseness of the local data, we hope to look for both local and topical context, and we 
have begun experimenting with various ways of acquiring the local context.
Local context can be derived from a variety of sources, including WordNet. The nouns 
in WordNet are organized in a hierarchical tree structure based on hypernomy/hyponomy. 
The hypernym of a noun is its superordinate, and the is a kind of relation exists between 
a noun and its hypernym. For example, line is a hypernym of conga line, which is to 
say that a conga line is a kind of line. Conversely, conga line is a hyponym of line. 
Polysemous words tend to have hyponyms that are monosemous collocations incorporating 
the polysemous Word: product line is a monosemous hyponym of the merchandise sense of 
line; any occurrence of product line can be recognized immediately as an instance of that 
sense. Similarly, phone line is a hyponym of the telephone connection sense of line, actor's 
line is a hyponym of the text sense of line, etc. These collocational hyponyms provide a 
convenient starting point for the construction of local contexts for polysemous words.
We are also experimenting with template matching, suggested by Weiss as one ap-
proach to using local context to resolve word senses [12]. In template matching, specific 
word patterns recognized as being indicative of a particular sense (the templates) are 
used to select a sense when a template is contained in the novel context; otherwise word 
co-occurrence within the context (topical context) is used to select a sense. Weiss initially 
used templates that were created by hand, and later derived templates automatically from 
his dataset. Unfortunately, the datasets available to Weiss at the time were very small, 
and his results are inconclusive. We are investigating a similar approach using the line 
data: training contexts are used to both automatically extract indicative templates and 
create topical sense vectors.
To create the templates, the system extracts contiguous subsets of tokens including 
the target word and up to two tokens on either side of the target as candidate templates.' 
The system keeps a count of the number of times each candidate template occurs in all 
of the training contexts. A candidate is selected as a template if it occurs in at least n of 
the training contexts and one sense accounts for at least m% of its total occurrences. For 
example, Figure 2 shows the templates formed when this process is used on a training set 
of 200 contexts for each of six senses when n = 10 and m = 75. The candidate template 
blurs the line is not selected as a template with these parameter settings because it does 
not occur frequently enough in the training corpus; the candidate template line of is not
51n the template learning phase, tokens include punctuation and stop words. No steznrning is performed 
and case distinctions are significant.

selected because it appears too frequently in both the product line and formation contexts.
With the exception of his line (cord) and line was (phone), these templates readily 
suggest their corresponding sense. The n = 10 and m = 75 parameter settings are 
relatively stringent criteria for template formation, so not many templates are formed, 
but those templates that are formed tend to be highly indicative of the sense.
Preliminary results show template matching improves the performance of the content 
vector classifier. The six-sense experiment was repeated using a simple decision tree to 
incorporate the templates: The sense corresponding to the longest template contained in a 
test context was selected for that context; if the context contained no template, the sense 
chosen by the vector classifer was selected. The templates were automatically created 
from the same training set as was used to create the content vectors. To be selected as a 
template, a candidate had to appear at least 3 times for the training sets that included 
50 of each sense, 5 times for the 100 each training sets, and 10 times for the 200 each 
training sets. In all cases, a single sense had to account for at least 75% of a candidate's 
occurrences. This hybrid approach was more accurate than the content vector classifier 
alone on each of the 9 trials. The average accuracy when trained using 200 contexts of 
each sense was 75% for the hybrid approach compared to 72% for the content vectors 
alone.
Other researchers have also suggested methods for incorporating local information into 
a classifier. Yarowsky found collocations' to be such powerful sense indicators that he 
suggests choosing a sense by matching on a set of collocations and choosing the most 
frequent sense if no collocation matches [13]. To resolve syntactic ambiguities, Resnik
6Yarowslcy uses the term collocation to denote constructs similar to what we have called templates.

investigated four different methods for combining three sources of information [8]. The 
"backing off" strategy, in which the three sources of information were tried in order from 
most reliable to least reliable until some match was found (no resolution was done if no 
method matched), maintained high precision (81%) and produced substantially higher 
recall (95%) than any single method.
Our plans for incorporating templates into the content vector classifier include inves-
tigating the significance of the tradeoff between the reliability of the templates and the 
number of templates that are formed. When stringent criteria are used for template for-
mation, and the templates are thought to be highly reliable sense indicators, the sense 
corresponding to a matched template will always be selected, and the sense vectors will 
be used only when no template match occurs. When the templates are thought to be less 
reliable, the choice of sense will be a function of the uniqueness of a matched template 
(if any) and the sense vector similarities. By varying the relative importance of a tem-
plate match and sense vector similarity we will be able to incorporate different amounts 
of topical and local information into the template classifier.
5 Conclusion
The capacity to determine the intended sense of an ambiguous word is an important 
component of any general system for language understanding. We believe that, in order 
to accomplish this task, we need contextual representations of word senses containing both 
topical and local context. Initial experiments focused on methods that are able to extract 
topical context. These methods are effective, but topical context alone is not sufficient 
for sense resolution tasks. The human subject experiment shows that even people are not 
very good at resolving senses when given only topical context. Currently we are testing 
methods for learning local context for word senses. Preliminary results show that the 
addition of template matching on local context improves performance.
